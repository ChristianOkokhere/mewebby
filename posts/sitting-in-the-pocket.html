        I super new to the sport, but in an effort to collect all of the Americain dad hobbies, Ive started watching Sunday Night football(lawn mowing is next, im starting early). Comentators consitantly site pocket precense as a defining charecteristic of a good quarterback. To me the word "precense" seemse to refernce temporality, and I assumed that:
        
        <ol>
            <li>The best quarterbacks are waiters on average</li>
            <li>There is a real benifit from waiting, because best read on a defense comes towards the end of a plays life span</li>
            <li>The worst quarterback struggle to step into the pocket, rushing to create offense</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is straight up wrong.
        <ol>
            <li>The best quarterbacks on average get rid of the ball in under <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-top-10-quarterbacks-clean-pocket-passing-grade-joe-burrow-patrick-mahomes-jalen-hurts">~2.5</href></a> seconds</li>
            <li>Quarterbacks get put under pressure more than <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-the-perfect-timing-a-deeper-dive-into-time-to-throw-data">60%</a> of the time if they hold onto the ball for <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-the-perfect-timing-a-deeper-dive-into-time-to-throw-data">3</a> seconds or longer</li>
            <li>The best quarterbacks are <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-the-perfect-timing-a-deeper-dive-into-time-to-throw-data">high functioning</a> in the pocket having <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-the-perfect-timing-a-deeper-dive-into-time-to-throw-data">high</a>under pressure passing ratings</li>
        </ol>

        I find this whole thought exercise intersting because these qualities seem seem profession agnostic. Startup hardos looovvee to say(may edit this):
        <ul>
            <li>Shipping fast matters</li>
            <li>Time between thought and iteration should be near zero</li>
            <li>Learning to do things well with real stakes breeds problem solvers</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Need a closer FUUUUUUKKK
        People could benifit more from sitting in the pocket. Not because waiting is admerable, but because restling with real problems forces one to trust that both their work and intuition will birth an optomistic future. (the banger ending) may change this to, but because all that matters is executing under pressure(better said)

        Loose thoughts I had while writing:
        <ol>
            <li>How long is too long, and how long is too short. People will tell you to just ship it, but there is a real need to understand what is worth shipping, and when. You can't time the market, but you can at least have context.</li>
            <li>Following the above line, once you have commited to something how do you know when to go down or when to scramble?</li>
            <li>Football lowk goated, I didn't realize how many advanced stats nerds where here too.
</li>
        </ol>
